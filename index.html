	<h1>Richard Nunziante Introduction</h1>
	<img src="myimage.jpg"/>
	<h3> Personal Overview</h3>
	<p>I graduated St. John's University with a BS in Finance. I interned for a small IT consulting company during college and decided
to stay in this field after they offered me a full-time job. I've worked for a few companies in various roles; help desk, server operations, R&D, training, project management, 
and consulting. At the beginning of 2017 I decided to make a career change, within IT, and moved to IS governance.</p>

	<h3> Academic Goals</h3>
	<p>I chose this NJIT Masters degree because it provides a 
	well-rounded education is different IT areas; both technical 
	and academic. My goals are to become more educated in 
	SW development and web-based technologies plus gain a fundamental 
	understanding of business management. </p>

	<h3> Professional Goals</h3>
	<p>Since moving to IS Security Governance my professional goals are the following:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Earn my Masters Degree</li>
  <li>Earn my CCSP</li>
  <li>Move into Security Architecture with a focus on Cloud security</li>
  	 </ul>

	<h3> IT Experience</h3>
	<p> I've spent over 20+ years in the IT industry with time spent in many areas. My primary focuses have been in MS Active Directory and VMware. Before moving to governance, I began working on more cloud-based projects in AWS and Office 365. My Linux and HTML skills aren't great nor are my general coding skills. </p>
